You are given a CSV file that contains trade data in the following format:
TradeID,Symbol,Quantity,Price,Date
1,AAPL,100,134.25,2023-07-01
2,GOOG,50,2715.30,2023-07-02
...
Write a Python function to read the CSV file, calculate the total value of each trade (quantity * price), and return a dictionary with TradeID as keys and the total trade value as values. Handle any errors that may occur during the file reading and data processing.
